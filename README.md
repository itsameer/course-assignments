This is a simple Java project I made for practice.  
It is a small command-line program that can do basic things with folders and files, like moving between directories, creating new folders or files, and listing contents.

I am still learning Java, so this is a basic version.

## What the program does

The program supports these commands:

- `pwd` → shows the current folder
- `ls` → shows the files and folders in the current folder
- `cd <name>` → go into a folder (use `..` to go back)
- `mkdir <name>` → create a new folder
- `touch <name>` → create a new empty file
- `help` → shows all commands
- `exit` → close the program

3. Open terminal or command line.

4. Go to the project folder, then type:
This will compile the code.

5. Then run it:
## Notes

- This project is for learning, so it's very simple.
- It doesn't check for all errors.
- It only works with basic folder and file commands.
- I wrote this by following what we learned in class.
